Email Configuration
   You can configure the email that is being sent in your airflow.cfg 
   by setting a subject_template and/or a html_content_template in the [email] section.
   you can create a connection called smtp_default of Email type, 
   or choose a custom connection name and set the email_conn_id with it’s name in the 
   configuration & store SMTP username-password in it
   
   Example
      [email]
      email_backend = airflow.utils.email.send_email_smtp
      subject_template = /path/to/my_subject_template_file
      html_content_template = /path/to/my_html_content_template_file
Send email using SendGrid
   Airflow can be configured to send e-mail using SendGrid.
   The steps to enable it are :
      1) Include sendgrid provider as part of your Airflow installation, e.g.,
         pip install 'apache-airflow-providers-sendgrid' --constraint ... or 'apache-airflow[sendgrid]' --constraint ...
      2) Update email_backend property in [email] section of the airflow.cfg file
         [email]
         email_backend = airflow.providers.sendgrid.utils.emailer.send_email
         email_conn_id = sendgrid_default
      3) Create a connection called sendgrid_default, or choose a custom connection name 
      and set it in email_conn_id of ‘Email’ type. 
      Only login and password are used from the connection
