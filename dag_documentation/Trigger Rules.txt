Trigger Rules
   By default, Airflow will wait for all upstream tasks for a task to be successful 
   before it runs that task.
   However, this is just the default behaviour, and you can control it using trigger_rule 
   argument to a Task. The options for trigger_rule are below.
   You almost never want to use all_success or all_failed downstream of a branching operation.
   You should instead set trigger_rule to none_failed_min_one_success in the task
   1) all_success (default): All upstream tasks have succeeded

      2) all_failed: All upstream tasks are in a failed or upstream_failed state

      3) all_done: All upstream tasks are done with their execution

      4) one_failed: At least one upstream task has failed (does not wait for all upstream tasks to be done)

      5) one_success: At least one upstream task has succeeded 
      (does not wait for all upstream tasks to be done)

      6) none_failed: All upstream tasks have not failed or upstream_failed - 
      that is, all upstream tasks have succeeded or been skipped

      7) none_failed_min_one_success: All upstream tasks have not failed or upstream_failed,
      and at least one upstream task has succeeded.

      8) none_skipped: No upstream task is in a skipped state - 
      that is, all upstream tasks are in a success, failed, or upstream_failed state

      9) always: No dependencies at all, run this task at any time
