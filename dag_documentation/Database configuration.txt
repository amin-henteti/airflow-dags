SQLite database can be used to run Airflow for development purpose 
as it does not require any database server (the database is stored in a local file)
But it only works with Sequential Executor and it should NEVER be used for PODUCTION.

Note, that this is not a python library version, 
it's the SQLite ((system-level application)) that needs to be upgraded.
to see what version is used by the python interpreter use the python shell by typing python in the developpement environment
the imporrt sqlite3 > sqlite3.sqlite_version

make sure that the "high-enough" version of SQLite is the only version installed in your system.
